# SL-login-python
Second Life login and packet dump in Python. Fork of an old project circa 2007.

This program does a login to Second Life and dumps packets. That's all it does. It's a base for debug and test work. Useful only to developers.

# History

The original source is from a [defunct project from 2007 called "libsecondlife".](https://web.archive.org/web/20070819045642/http://www.libsecondlife.org/wiki/Main_Page). 

A [version of this code can be found on the Second Life Wiki.](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Presence_Code_Python)

Some discussion is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080131121212/http://www.libsecondlife.org/wiki/Login)

At one time, there was an organization called the "Open Metaverse Foundation", which archived or created
some of this material. Their web site is long gone, but
[remnants of their code repository can be found in the Internet Archive.](http://openmetaverse.org/svn/omf/libopenmetaverse/trunk/)

# Status

The original version was in Python 2. It's been updated here to work with Python 3.10.

There is no support.
